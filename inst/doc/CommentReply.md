Professor Drake raises some interesting observations in our data in his comment on our recent paper, "Early warning signals and the Prosecutor's Fallacy".  In particular, he observes that the early warning signal statistics we compute are statistically different between the trajectories that experience a chance transition relative to the distribution of those statistics in the background at large.  We acknowledge this difference but do not consider it to be a demonstration of an early warning signal.  In our opinion, the correct comparison to make to qualify as an early warning signal should demonstrate that trajectories that transition by chance show a statistically significant difference in the proposed signal than trajectories that have assumed the same most recent state $x_T$, rather than against all background trajectories.  We believe this is most consistent wit hthe notion of what we mean by an early warning signal and is the reason others have argued that signals of stochastic transitions do not exist.  Our differences in the choices null distribution will lead to differences in intepretation of early warning signals, and highlight an important question deserving greater attention by both theoretical and empirical research in the early warning signal community.  

In Figure 1, we show a distribution of the $\tau$ statistic in all trajectories that have a deviation of greater than 2 standard deviations from the fluctuations, relative to the distribution of $\tau$ in the population at large.  Like the example considered by Professor Drake, this difference is statistically significantly different under a t-test. 




## early comments to Alan


John raises some very good observations and potentially interesting spin on our article.  There certainly is a persistent claim in the literature that stochastic transitions do not show early warning.  As such, I would welcome the discussion of the issue, which also does us the favor of drawing attention to this piece, and presumably giving us space for a reply as well.  

On the other hand, here is my concern with John's observation.  If we instead conditioned on all cases that got close to the tipping point but never actually collapsed, we would observe the exact same thing here.  The pattern is of course driven by the nature of large excursions, (if you want to get really far running up hill, best to run fast (big variance) and continually in the uphill direction (autcorrelation)).  Therefore I think it is an overstatement to refer to this as evidence of an approaching stochastic transition.  It is really just a signal of a large deviation, (and worse, not a good one -- if you wanted to find large deviations you'd compare trajectories against the mean position, not the windowed autocorrelation).  

It appears our difference is semantics though.  I've mentioned this to John, and his view is that, quite simply, these trajectories that scholastically transition do show a different signal than the background population.  And that's perfectly true.  It comes down to what is the relevant background population (e.g. if we compared those trajectories against others that had achieved the same displacement from the mean, the differences would vanish).  So in the end, it is semantics about what we mean by a "signal" and the relevant baseline.  Of course wrestling with the definitions of when we have and haven't detected a signal, and what the relevant baselines are, are both crucial issues for the field of early warning at large to address, not just a problem technical examples.  So this would be a good opportunity to draw attention to those bigger issues.
