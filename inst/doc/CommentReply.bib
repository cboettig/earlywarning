abstract = {Regime shifts from one ecological state to another are often portrayed as sudden, dramatic, and difficult to reverse. Yet many regime shifts unfold slowly and imperceptibly after a tipping point has been exceeded, especially at regional and global scales. These long, smooth transitions between equilibrium states are easy to miss, ignore, or deny, confounding management and governance. However, slow responses by ecosystems after transgressing a dangerous threshold also affords borrowed time - a window of opportunity to return to safer conditions before the new state eventually locks in and equilibrates. In this context, the most important challenge is a social one: convincing enough people to confront business-as-usual before time runs out to reverse unwanted regime shifts even after they have already begun.},

@Article{	  Dakos2008,
  abstract	= {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable
		  climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to
		  a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of
		  abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system
		  reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains
		  hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even
		  more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a
		  tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future.
		  Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and
		  show that they were all preceded by a characteristic
		  slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the
		  actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased
		  autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a
		  hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply
		  independent empirical evidence for the idea that past
		  abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical
		  thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is
		  fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that
		  our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal
		  early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change.
		  Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex
		  systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this
		  is a promising perspective.},

abstract = {Although the causes of population extinction are well understood, the speed at which populations decline to extinction is not. A testable, counter-intuitive prediction of stochastic population theory is that, on average, for any interior interval of the domain of biologically attainable population sizes, the expected duration of increase equals the expected duration of decline. Here we report the first empirical tests of this hypothesis. Using data from two experiments in which replicate populations of Daphnia magna were observed to go extinct under different experimental conditions, we failed to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the growth and decline phases in populations under constant conditions and conditions with modest environmental variability, but find strong evidence to reject equal first passage time in highly variable environments. These results confirm the prediction of equal passage times entailed by diffusion models of population dynamics, supporting continued application in both population theory and conservation decision making under the restricted conditions where the approximation can be expected to hold.},
